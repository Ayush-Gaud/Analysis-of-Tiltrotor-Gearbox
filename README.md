# Analysis-of-Tiltrotor-Gearbox

A MATLAB-based dynamic simulation and analysis of a tiltrotor gearbox system, done as part of the course AE233M: Introduction to Vibrations at IIT Kanpur. The project models coupled rotational inertias with nonlinear damping and torsional stiffness using Newtonian mechanics and state-space modeling. It compares nonlinear and linearized system responses under varying torque inputs and includes full code for simulation, stability analysis, and performance metrics.
